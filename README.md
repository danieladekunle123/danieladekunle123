### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Daniel and I'm a computer science student from Ireland, and I'm genuinely excited about all things tech. I enjoy learning and adapting to new areas in this ever-evolving field.
I'm eager to connect with like-minded enthusiasts and explore new opportunities in technology. 
Let's build something amazing together!
